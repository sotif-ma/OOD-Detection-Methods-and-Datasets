This file contains codes for calculating Flops

For Glow:
Original code from https://github.com/y0ast/Glow-PyTorch. We revised it for calculating Flops.
(1) cd to Flops/Glow-PyTorch-master/
(2) python main.py using the terminal
(3) copy all intergers into ops.txt
you can skip (1)(2)(3) since we have done this for ops.txt
(4) python sum.py using the terminal

For PixelCNN++:
Original code from https://github.com/pclucas14/pixel-cnn-pp. We revised it for calculating Flops.
(1) cd to Flops/pixel-cnn-pp-master/
(2) python main.py using the terminal
(3) copy all intergers between two strings "0******" into ops.txt
you can skip (1)(2)(3) since we have done this for ops.txt
(4) python sum.py using the terminal
