# A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks
Implementations of the experiments found in _A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks_ by Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02136

Most results are in Jupyter notebooks since several data sets used have licensing restrictions (e.g., TIMIT, WSJ PTB, etc.).
